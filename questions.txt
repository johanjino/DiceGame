1. Agent goroutine still running when attempt to removing it. How to do this safely
2. Where is `CreateHelloWorld` function used?
3. Iteration vs Turns
4. Do agents reset score?
5. Broadcast message not send to itself right?
6. No interface for Message Base class? Atleast not in helloworld

Question to myself, some agents have score 20, how?
